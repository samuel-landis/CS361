a = Case with no obstacles and several items.
b = Case with multiple obstacles and fewer items.
c = Case with a complex grid layout requiring different paths to optimize.
d = Case with only one item in a corner of the grid.

x = rows, cols, start x, start y
0 = 5, 5, 0, 0

3 = 500, 500, 0, 0
4 = 50, 50, 31, 47
